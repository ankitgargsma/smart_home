One can access lights/fans and various other home appliances anywhere across the globe just using a mobile app. The project uses IoT (Internet of Things).

And if the person wants to access in his/her home only that limited distance then bluetooth module (HC-05) will do the needful.

As now a days everyone seeks comfort and security so for the persons who want to control the appliances and lights/fans/switches remotely from anywhere in the world then he/she can do using this project. It may also be helpful especially for elderly and handicapped people. 

You just need a NodeMCU module(ESP8266), a relay module (its pins depends on your requirement of how many things you want to automate), a stable internet connection and yes a mobile app to communicate over the cloud platform you'll use. And thats it.

# DTMF Version (Instructions to operate) - 
if you press 1 – Device 1 will be ON.

if you press 2 – Device 1 will be OFF.

if you press 3 – Device 2 will be ON.

if you press 4 – Device 2 will be OFF.

if you press 5 – Device 3 will be ON.

if you press 6 – Device 3 will be OFF.

if you press 7 – Device 4 will be ON.

if you press 8 – Device 4 will be OFF.

This is how this kit works. Because the tone produced by pressing the numbers on the keypad are decoded into the digital format of binary which is interpreted as its decimal equivalent by the DTMF module.

Note: Also please read the ratings of relays, attached devices should be with in the limits of relay rating.
