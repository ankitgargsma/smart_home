# home_automation
One can access lights/fans and various other home appliances anywhere across the globe just using a mobile app. The project uses IoT (Internet of Things). And if the person wants to access in his/her home only that limited distance then bluetooth module (HC-05) will do the needful.
As now a days everyone seeks comfort and security so for the persons who want to control the appliances and lights/fans/switches remotely from anywhere in the world then he/she can do using this project. It may also be helpful especially for elderly and handicapped people. 
You just need a NodeMCU module(ESP8266), a relay module (its pins depends on your requirement of how many things you want to automate), a stable internet connection and yes a mobile app to communicate over the cloud platform you'll use. And thats it.
